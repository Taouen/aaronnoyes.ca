        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a software developer with a BSc majoring in Computer Science
          specializing in Networks and Security at the University of Manitoba.
          Prior to the University of Manitoba attended the University of Alberta
          where I played football and studied computer science. My primary
          interests lie in software and network security, as well as web and
          mobile development. I have been programming as a hobby since 2010 and
          for my studies since 2015. Most of my school work was written in
          C/C++, Java, and Python. For personal interest I have also learned
          about web and iOS development by taking courses on Udemy, and doing
          self guided learnng in my free time.

            nn is a simplistic neural network class built in python using NumPy.
            The purpose of this project was to analyze the selection of
            hyper-parameters in network training and compare their performance
            on a training dataset. A paper is attached to the project with
            explanations and analysis. One of the other focuses was to explain
            some of the basic math behind training a fully-connected neural
            network.

        <Project title="seedVPN">
          <p>
            This project implements a simple VPN using the Linux tun/tap driver
            created as a final project for a security course. A UDP tunnel is
            used to relay IP packets through a virtual TUN device. Each message
            is encrypted using AES-256 and secured using HMACs. A shared key is
            established on client connection via a TLS control channel
            implemented using OpenSSL.
          </p>
          <p>
            A handful of dynamic reconfiguration commands exist through the TLS
            channel which allow for the key and other parameters to be changed.

            A group project for school aimed to improve the user experience of
            registering for courses. My primary contribution was the search
            engine and course registration system. Courses are listed clearly
            with a responsive search. An emphasis was placed on user interaction
            and page readability.
